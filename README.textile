h1. Notre Dame toolbar extensions

This is a collection of browser extensions.

The purpose is to mimic the ND.edu Popular Sites functionality. I'm starting with the Safari version with plans to add Firefox and Chrome versions.

h2. Use

Click on the "Downloads" link and select the most recent version. Be sure to turn on automatic updates in Safari.

Windows users be sure you have QuickTime installed if you want the Victory March to work.
